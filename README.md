# ESP8266-Dallas-1-Wire-Temperature-Controller
A simple temperature controller using the DS18B20, written in MicroPython

This code simply uses the Dallas 1-Wire bus to fire outputs on whichever pin the user specifies.  The MicroPython AP is disabled as I intend to use the controller
as a permanent installation and will not need to adjust temperature settings.  Feel free to add this to your IoT project if you desire remote control of the
device or remote readings.
